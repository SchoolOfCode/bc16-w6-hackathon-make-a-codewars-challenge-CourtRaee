# Which LEGO set should I buy?

You want to buy a new LEGO set, but only have 180 minutes to build it. If each individual piece takes X time to build and you have Y total amount of pieces, will you have time to complete it?

If yes, return true. If no, return false.

❓Example: If each piece takes 2 minutes to build and I have 50 pieces, return true.
